## Linear Regression on prostate cancer data

The data are from The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL, [link](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/prostate.data)) and originally
from the study of Stamey et al. (1989).  
You can find the data in [data/prostate.csv](../../data/prostate.csv) in this repository.

Response variable : 
- Level of prostate-specific antigen (lpsa)

Predictors:
- log cancer volume (lcavol)
- log prostate weight (lweight)
- age
- log of the amount of benign prostate hyperplasia (lbph)
- seminal vesicle invasion (svi)
- log of capsular penetration (lcp)
- Gleason score (gleason)
- percent of Gleason scores 4 or 5 (pgg45)
